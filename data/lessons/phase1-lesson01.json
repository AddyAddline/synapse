MATLAB (short for **MAT**rix **LAB**oratory) is a powerful tool used by scientists all over the world to analyze data — including brain signals from EEG experiments.\n\nDon't worry if you've never written code before. We'll start from the very basics.\n\n## Your First Command\n\nThe simplest thing you can do in MATLAB is display text on the screen. Try this:\n\n```matlab\ndisp('Hello, Neuroscience!')\n```\n\n`disp` is short for **display**. It shows whatever you put inside the parentheses.\n\n## Basic Math\n\nMATLAB is like a powerful calculator. Try these:\n\n```matlab\n2 + 3\n10 - 4\n5 * 3\n20 / 4\n2 ^ 3\n```\n\nThe `^` symbol means \"to the power of\" — so `2^3` means 2 × 2 × 2 = 8.\n\n## Semicolons: To Show or Not to Show\n\nNotice what happens when you add a semicolon `;` at the end:\n\n```matlab\n5 + 3      % This shows the result: 8\n5 + 3;     % This runs silently (no output shown)\n```\n\nThe `%` symbol starts a **comment** — text that MATLAB ignores. It's for your own notes.\n\n## The `disp` Function\n\nYou can display numbers too:\n\n```matlab\ndisp(42)\ndisp(3.14159)\n```\n\nAnd you can combine text with numbers using `num2str`:\n\n```matlab\nage = 25;\ndisp(['I am ' num2str(age) ' years old'])\n```\n\n## Why This Matters for Neuroscience\n\nEvery analysis you'll do — loading EEG data, filtering brain signals, calculating frequencies — starts with these basic commands. Think of this as learning the alphabet before writing stories about the brain!",
